This library depends on [react-native-safe-area-context](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context). If you use [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org) you probably already have it in your dependencies, so you're good to go. If not, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context) to install it. Then run:

`yarn add @flyerhq/react-native-chat-ui`
